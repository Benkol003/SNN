### Working:

SNN_MNIST.ipynb - spiking feedforward neural network, spike rate for encoding,decoding,loss, with ATAN surrogate gradient. 
torch_MNIST.ipynb - Feedforward neural network with ReLU neurons & cross entropy loss, for comparison with SNN's

### WIP:
SNN_deepr_MNIST.ipynb - implement deepr algorithm 
SNN_MNIST_CUDA.ipynb - have everything on CUDA, & test for speedup - SNN takes a lot longer to train!
