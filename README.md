### Working:

SNN_MNIST.ipynb - spiking feedforward neural network, spike rate for encoding,decoding,loss, with ATAN surrogate gradient. 
torch_MNIST.ipynb - Feedforward neural network with ReLU neurons & cross entropy loss, for comparison with SNN's
torch_MNIST_deepr.ipynb - dynamic rewiring works with good accuracy 

### WIP:
SNN_deepr_MNIST.ipynb - apply DEEPR to SNN MNIST to obtain good accuracy
