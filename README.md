### Deep Rewiring in Neural Networks

Please install snnTorch from source! there are useful performance fixes that have not made it to the current pip release.

deepr.py implements the Deepr algorithm from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05136.

## TODO

Update to use trainer class and PRNG seeded samplers - SNN deepr, SNN CNN, SNN latency - CNN & latency need deepr equivalents aswell.

possible merge models & testing for deepr / non-deepr variants into one notebook?
