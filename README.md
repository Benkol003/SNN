### Working:

SNN_MNIST.ipynb - spiking feedforward neural network, spike rate for encoding,decoding,loss, with ATAN surrogate gradient. 
torch_MNIST.ipynb - Feedforward neural network with ReLU neurons & cross entropy loss, for comparison with SNN's

### WIP:
SNN_deepr_MNIST.ipynb - implement deepr algorithm\ start with having same network/accuracy with 100% connectivity
