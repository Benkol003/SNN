### Deep Rewiring in Neural Networks

Please install snnTorch from source! there are useful performance fixes that have not made it to the current pip release.

### Deep R algorithm
deepr.py implements the Deepr algorithm from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05136.

experiments are done in jupyter notebooks; they are mnemomically named with the type of model, dataset and if using Deep R.
